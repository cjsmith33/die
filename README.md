Final project for CIS551

In this module, you worked more in Codio as you began to use Python files and modules. You were introduced to Atom Editor, a program for editing code files on your computer, which you can use even after this course ends. You examined the difference between modules and scripts, and finally, you completed an activity in which you created a sequence of Python statements to create a complete program.
